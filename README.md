# gpt2

A pure-go implementation of the GPT-2 language model in Golang.



If reading the code, I reccomend cloning the repo locally and using an IDE with a Go language server to get the best experience as the golang implementation incurs a lot of boilerplate code without the help of a library like pytorch.
