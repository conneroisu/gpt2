# gpt2

A pure-go implementation of the GPT-2 language model in Golang.

My dog went on a playdate and I wanted to see how fast I could create a GPT-2 cli in Golang that is able to do infernce and training.

If reading the code, I reccomend cloning the repo locally and using an IDE with a Go language server to get the best experience as the golang implementation incurs a lot of boilerplate code without the help of a library like pytorch.
